# InsPicture

InsPicture is a photography review and classification solution that allows you to manually add tags to your images by
pressing one single key. You can customize the tags used, add new ones and change their name. These tags will later
convert into folders where your images are get copied into, classified.

Images with the same name in the same directory (e.g. `IMG_0001.jpg` and `IMG_0001.cr3`) will count as one, and will get
displayed, tagged and copied together as one for convenience.

## Requirements

- `Java 21.0.1` or up
